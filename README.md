# Starter project for a web-app using Node, Express, and the GDS templates

This is a minimal project using express and node witht he GDS toolkit templates.

## Get Started

Clone this repo

Install the dependencies required to run the service and start the server in:

  ```
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```  
Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

Alternatively, for development you can run "gulp" to start the server with nodemon and watch for asset changes. 

## Project Structure

 - app - contains client views and routes
 - assets - contains static assets and raw JS and SCSS
 - gulp - contains gulp build tasks
 - public - is generated by the build to contain assets and processed JS and CSS. Contents of public are exposed by express
 - govuk_modules - generated by the build containing GDS template assets

## Developer Guide

### Gulp
The build uses gulp. Add your own gulp tasks in /gulp or below.

The following are provided:

 - tasks.js - default and build tasks that compose other tasks
 - copy-assets - moves assests to /public 
 - copy-modules - moves the GDS layouts, assets, and SASS from the dependency into govuk_modules
 - nodemon - starts the server
 - sass - processes SASS into public/stylesheets
 - watch - watches for changes to sass and assets and regenerates
 - clean - removes all generated content from /public, /govuk_modules etc
 
NB This is a minimal starter so there is no JS processing or testing. Add your own.
 
### Node Server 
 
server.js is kept simple and does the following

- Use nunjucks as the template engine
- Exposes static resources /public, /govuk_modules
- Sets routing to use app/routes.js 
 
### How to use the templates
